# Potato-disease-classification

The Potato Disease Classification Project aims to build a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying different diseases in potato plants. By using deep learning algorithms, the project seeks to assist farmers and agricultural experts in early disease detection, enabling them to take necessary measures to protect their potato crops and improve overall yield.
